----- Version 0.6.3 -----
0. Bugs removed:
- fastviterbi.c in win64 was not compiling.
  This was a matlab/VSC++ problem with the name of the function "max".
  All .c files now have names that reflect the file's name (e.g. "fv_max")
  Also removed include of stdlib which was not needed for anything, and was
  thought to have had something to do with the problem.
 
1. Improvements in documentation. Clearer install procedures.

1. Made condloglikfun an abstract method of HMM.
This might be seen as a decrease usability for some users,
however they would have probably never used the vanilla version of the code with the 
fminsearch m-step solver, so almost surely they will need to subclass.
So for most users this is a usability win, since their code will be all in the same place.
